"""Area-first layout: size the patches to fill a target grid in the usable area.

The default engine layout is *patch-first* — you set the patch size and it fits
as many as possible, so the block rarely reaches the far margin. *Area-first*
(Knut's request, #93) flips it: you say how many strips (columns) and/or patches
per strip (rows) you want, and the engine derives the patch size so the grid
fills the usable area exactly. Patch size becomes the result, not the input.

This is a pre-process on the build-kwargs: it derives ``patch_w`` / ``patch_h``
and lets the normal patch-first geometry place them — so the capacity estimate
and the render stay in lock-step (they share the derived sizes), and instrument
constraints (clip border, label band, spacers, cut lines) are honoured because
the derivation measures a real provisional geometry.
