"""Device-RGB patch-set generators for the chart layout editor.

Each generator returns a list of ``(R, G, B)`` device-value tuples on the
**0..100** scale — exactly the "device-value program" the editor mutates
(see :mod:`workflow.ti2_relayout`). They are pure: no Qt, no Argyll, no I/O,
so they unit-test cleanly and can be combined and spliced into a program in
any order.

The five generators back the New-chart dialog's "Generate colour sets" mode
(GitHub #37): an even RGB cube, Fitzpatrick skin-tone ramps, enhanced blues /
turquoise, enhanced foliage greens, and near-neutral greys.

A note on "device RGB": ChromIQ builds *unprofiled* test charts, so these are
printer device codes, not colorimetric targets. The skin / blue / green
palettes are sRGB-reasoned starting points chosen to concentrate patches where
the issue asks for denser coverage; they are deliberately easy to retune.

      the cones mostly intact while many steps carve out more. The dropped
      patches aren't lost: the per-end budget is re-laid in the rims that remain.
